This order acknowledgement does not mean that his/her order has been accepted. the acceptance of customer order will be confirmed by sending to the customer an e-mail that confirms that the Products have been dispatched (“Order Confirmation”). If GIVENCHY and/or Global-e suspect someone’s identity, address, email address and/or payment information is being used fraudulently or in an unauthorized manned, additional verification or information may be required before accepting any order.

Moreover, an order may be cancelled (in full or in part) even after the Order Confirmation was dispatched, if GIVENCHY or Global-e acting on its behalf suspect there could be, or actually were such circumstances (on our part or any third party’s part) giving rise to a good faith, genuine or honest error, mistake or misunderstanding pursuant to which Global-e acting on behalf of GIVENCHY would neither have sent the Order Confirmation nor agreed to sell the Products. An example could be a specious low price for a product otherwise costing significantly more. In the event of such genuine error, customer shall receive a properly detailed notice of cancellation, following which customer’s order will be automatically cancelled, and customer will be refunded the amounts customer actually paid.</p>

                  <p>The prices of Products are stated in Local Currency where the order is placed and include any applicable sales taxes, plus any eventual international delivery costs and fees (“<b>Delivery Costs</b>”) and, if applicable and available for pre-payment, any eventual import duties, tariffs and similar fees that may be imposed by the delivery destination (“<b>Import Charges</b>”). Without advanced notice and from time to time, Delivery Costs and/or Import Charges could be covered, partially or fully. The Website will provide details about such offers before completing and placing the order.</p>

                 <div class="box"> 
                  <h4><u>5.2. Import Charges</u></h4> 
                  <p>For certain delivery destinations and/or Products, the customer may be offered the option to pre-pay applicable Import Charges, which will then be calculated and added or included in the final price when he/she place the order. In certain cases, the price of the Product may already be inclusive of Import Charges.</p> 
                  <p>In the event that the option to pre-pay applicable Import Charges is available and the customer choose to pre-pay such Import Charges, or if the Import Charges were already included in the price of the Product, his/her final price will be fully guaranteed, and the actual Import Charges will be paid on his/her behalf to the applicable authorities, as determined by his/her delivery destination upon import of his/her order.</p> 
                  <p> Our partner Global-e may contract with a local licensed customs broker in the destination. Agreement to these Terms serve as an authorization for the applicable customs broker to act as your agent to: (i) conduct transactions with the local applicable authority, (ii) complete, submit and execute related documents on your behalf in connection with the import of Products in your order, (iii) facilitate the payment of applicable Import Charges; and (iv) if applicable, return such Product to GIVENCHY (subject to these Terms). However, you acknowledge that, in the case of a return of Product, you (and not GIVENCHY, Global-e or anyone on their behalf) will be fully responsible for claiming back such Import Charges from the applicable tax authority, to the extent possible, and neither Global-e, nor GIVENCHY shall have responsibility or liability in connection with such claim.</p> 
                  <p>The customer may decide not pre-pay the Import Charges at Checkout, or the option to pre-pay Import Charges may not be available for its delivery destination or the Product. In such cases (i.e. where pre-pay does not apply): (i) the customer is advised that the amount of Import Chares displayed under the pre-pay option on the checkout may not reflect the actual Import Charges payable by him/her as determined by his/her delivery destination’s relevant authority, which may be more or less than such estimate: and (ii) the customer will be fully responsible for paying all applicable Import Charges directly to the relevant authority (and for reclaiming them in the event of a cancellation or a return of Products, to the extent permitted in these Terms) as determined by the authorities of the delivery destination, and neither Global-e nor GIVENCHY shall have any responsibility or liability in connection with the foregoing. Moreover, if customer fail to pay Import Charges without reasonable reason causing the liability to fall on GIVENCHY, Global-e or the carrier, the liability amount of Import Charges may be deducted from any refund or other amounts customer may claim, to the extent permitted under applicable law.</p> 
                  <p>If customer elected not to pre-pay Import Charges, or failed to pay Import Charges, or refused to accept Products otherwise than in accordance with the return or cancellation procedure under these Terms, in each case resulting with the Products being returned or needing to be returned, then customer may be liable for the return delivery costs and may not be reimbursed or refunded for Delivery Costs paid by him/her for making the delivery to him/her. GIVENCHY or Global-e on its behalf may also charge customer with additional direct or indirect charges resulting from said failure or refusal, to the extent permitted under applicable law. GIVENCHY or Global-e on its behalf may, if that is in accordance with these Terms, reimburse and refund customer for the cost of the Products, but not the Import Charges which may or not be reimbursable by the relevant authority. </p>

                  <p>The customer may pay with the payment methods specified at Checkout. The availability of such payment methods is dependent on his/her geographical location.

                  <p>The customer acknowledge and agree that (i) he/she will be charged by Global-e or one of its third party payment processors (“<b>Payment Processor</b>”), through the payment method he/she have selected for his/her order and such other amounts payable under these Terms that may be due in connection with the order; (ii) he/she will provide valid and current information about himself/herself (iii) Givenchy and Global-e on its behalf may use the tools, software or services of Payment Processors to process transactions on their behalf; and (iv) he/she may be charged with additional fees (such as foreign transaction free or cross border fee) or charges imposed by his/her bank or credit/debit card issuer, and as these are not our charges or fees, GIVENCHY or Global-e have no control over such charges or fees nor do GIVENCHY or Global-e have any way to mitigate such charges or fees, as this is purely up to the relationship and commercial terms between the customer and customer bank or credit/debit card issuer, and GIVENCHY or Global-e also have no way of knowing in advance whether customer will be charged such charges or fees, as each bank and credit/debit issuer has its own policy, and GIVENCHY and Global-e commitment is to acquire the amount set at checkout in the customer local currency.</p> 
                  <p>Depending on customer location, payment may be routed through Global-e’s affiliate (i.e. Global-e Australia Pty Ltd or Global-e NL B.V.).</p> 
                  <p>If the payment method selected by the customer at checkout supports an authorization mechanism (e.g., most credit/debit cards), when the order is placed, only the applicable amount will be authorized. The customer will be charged only after the Product has been dispatched to him/her, unless the order is a “pre-order” or a similar type of order, in which case the charge could be made even before the Product has been dispatched, depending on the particulars of the pre-ordered Product. If the payment method that customer selected does not support an authorization mechanism, the charge will be immediate upon placing the order (or such other timing set by that specific payment method you used, if applicable). The customer will be charged the full order amount even if the order is dispatched in parts. Where PayPal/PayPal Express is offered as a payment method, the full amount of the purchase may be taken immediately following the placement of customer order. Pre-payment shall not affect customer legal rights under these Terms (including for example any right of refund).</p>
