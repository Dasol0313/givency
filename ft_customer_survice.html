                                As a leading luxury brand, Givenchy addresses the issue of counterfeiting every day.<br>
                                When a customer purchases a Givenchy product, they expect excellence of craftmanship and quality that lasts. Conversely, counterfeit replicas are most often made of inferior materials, with a demonstrable lack of know-how and artisanship, resulting in a product that does not stand the test of time.<br>
                                Counterfeit products infringe on our designers creativity and misappropriate the expertise of our craftspeople. The sole guarantee of quality and product durability lies in purchasing genuine Givenchy products.<br>
                                At Givenchy, we take the issue of counterfeiting extremely seriously. We constantly monitor and report purveyors of counterfeit wherever they are found, online and off.<br>
                                Authentic Givenchy products are sold exclusively in Givenchy stores, through our official website www.givenchy.com, and via a selective network of approved retailers.</p>

                            <p>The properties of certain materials and/or certain product&nbsp;finishes (wrinkled, lustre, etc.) are not designed to be permanent. Repeated washes will alter the clothes appearance over time. This is completely normal and gives the article&nbsp;of clothing its appeal and very special character.</p> 
                            <p>Please be aware of the risk of color transfer&nbsp;in personal items of clothing due to fabric dye from our products. Please read the following instructions carefully:</p> 
                            <p>&nbsp;</p> 
                            <p><u>Printed fabrics</u></p> 
                            <p>The printing on these fabrics are applied using traditional methods. Slight variations may arise – the visual variations between printed fabric designs are a natural result of this manufacturing process.</p> 
                            <p>* Avoid over-exposure to direct sunlight, artificial light or sources of high heat concentration.</p> 
                            <p>&nbsp;</p> 
                            <p><u>Leather items</u></p> 
                            <p>Leather is a natural material that&nbsp;needs to be handled with care. Different leathers will require care that is specifically tailored to their leather type.</p> 
                            <p>* Try not to let your leather items rub against other objects as this may lead to color transfer</p> 
                            <p>* Ensure your leather items are kept in a dry environment when not in use</p> 
                            <p>* Avoid over-exposure to direct sunlight, artificial light or sources of high heat concentration.</p> 
                            <p>&nbsp;</p> 
                            <p><u>Embroidered and/or sequined items </u></p> 
                            <p>Embroidered details are created using traditional techniques, even though these details give products more character they tend to be very fragile.These items therefore need to be treated with care.</p> 
                            <p>* Avoid allowing other objects to come in contact with your product in any way that could cause visible damage</p> 
                            <p>* Avoid over-exposing your embroidered or sequined items to direct sunlight, artificial light or sources of high heat concentration.</p>

                            <p><u>Denim items</u></p> 
                            <p>Denim items undergo specific treatments and washes which give them their unique, timeless character. Visual variations between denim items occur naturally as a result of these processes.</p> 
                            <p>These traditional treatments and processes may result in color&nbsp;transfer&nbsp;on the fabric’s surface. With washing, the effects of this transfer&nbsp;will slowly disappear.</p> 
                            <p>* Keep your denim items away from other light-colored fabrics, furniture, and articles&nbsp;of clothing</p> 
                            <p>* Avoid over-exposing your denim items to direct sunlight, artificial light or sources of high&nbsp;heat concentration</p>

                            <p><u>Bags</u></p>

                            <p>* Ensure that you store your leather goods in a cool, dry place inside the protective felt pouch designed for this purpose</p> 
                            <p>* Try not to let your leather goods rub against other objects as this may lead to colour migration.</p>
